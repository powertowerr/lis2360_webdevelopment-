    <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        
    <p>New emerging and revolutionary technologies are developing faster than ever before, and the reality of autonomous cars is quickly approaching around the corner.
    Our future transportation seems to inevitably involve self-driving vehicles. 
    Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are not required to take control to safely operate the vehicle.
    Most people are probably skeptical when first thinking about the idea of their car driving itself but there may be many benefits when it comes to this idea of driverless cars.
    </p>
    
    <p>First, let's talk about the technology behind the product and see how they operate.
    Driverless cars combine sensors and computer software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle. 
    Self-driving technologies have started being developed by multiple technology companies over the years, such as Google and Uber.
    Most designs for self-driving systems create and maintain an internal map of their surroundings, using a wide array of sensors.
    These sensors include lasers, radar, sonar, and high-powered cameras.
    </p>
        
    <p>Software then processes those sensor inputs, maps out a path, and sends directions to the vehicles <q>actuators</q>, or controlling mechanisms, which control the acceleration, braking, and steering.
    Predictive modeling, hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, and <q>smart</q> object discrimination help the software follow traffic rules and navigate through obstacles. 
    There are partially-autonomous vehicles which may require a human to intervene if the system detects an uncertainty, and fully-autonomous vehicles which may not include a steering wheel. 
    While these technology companies have just begun researching and developing these vehicles, the costs and benefits of self-driving cars are still mostly hypothetical. 
    </p>
        
    <p>There would be several impacts on society involving self-driving cars. Safety is a big concern when first thinking about driverless cars.
    Thousands of people die in motor vehicle crashes every year in the United States. Driverless cars could, hypothetically, reduce that death toll with computer software proving to be less error-prone than humans.
    However, the threat of cybersecurity and the full control of the vehicle is still a chief concern. The impacts on employed drivers and public transportation could have negative effects. 
    Environmental impacts are a serious concern and another uncertainty. Convenient driverless cars may increase the miles driven and if the cars are gasoline powered, transportation-related climate emissions could increase. 
    The opposite would be true if the vehicles were electrified. The bottom line being that driverless cars are certainly within our future but uncertainly should be.

    <p>In 2016, there were 2,578 <em>disengagement reports</em> among nine companies in California that carried out road-testing for driverless cars. These reports detail every instance a human driver had to safely take 
    control of the vehicle, either due to hardware or software failure. These results show where each company's progress is in relation to their self-driving vehicle research.</p>
